# WireLength
Given a set of multiple coordinates on a hypothetical breadboard, what is the length of wire needed to create the shortest possible path that forms a closed circuit?
The code implements Prim's algorithm. It adds the first 'node' to the list and begins to form a Minimum Spanning Tree by looping over all nodes to find the next closest node to the tree. In order to find the nearest node to the entire MST instead of mistakenly finding the closest distance to a specific node, the code intializes distances[]. On each subsequent iteration of the loop, the distances value is compared to the value of the last node added to the MST, if it is less, the distances array is updated to reflect that new shortest distance. This keeps the algorithm from running an exponential time complexity.
